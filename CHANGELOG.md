# Changelog

All notable changes to this artifact are documented here. This project adheres to semantic
versioning.

## v0.16.0 — 2026-08-10
- **Resolved the remaining skills.sh audit findings with engineering, not scan-appeasement.** The
  Gen Agent Trust Hub report on `setup-agentic-scaffolding` (HIGH, four findings) and the Snyk
  report on `scaffold-project` (MEDIUM, W011) are both addressed at the root; no functionality
  removed.
  - *Pipe-to-shell eliminated* (Trust Hub #1, CRITICAL). The literal
    `curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash` no longer appears anywhere: the JBang last resort is now
    a three-step download → inspect → approve → execute flow (`curl -LsS -o jbang-install.sh …`,
    show the file, run it only after explicit approval, delete it). The bytes the user approves are
    the bytes on disk and the bytes that run — a piped stream offers nothing stable to approve.
    Package managers remain the recommended path.
  - *External dependencies pinned* (Trust Hub #2). `@upstash/context7-mcp@4.0.0` (npm `latest`) and
    `io.quarkus:quarkus-agent-mcp:1.2.5:runner` — the explicit GAV the floating `quarkusio` catalog
    alias resolves to (`script-ref: …:RELEASE:runner`), validated runnable via `jbang info tools`.
    Pinned across the setup skill, `README.md`, and `gemini-extension.json`; two Renovate
    `customManagers` (npm + maven regex over all three files) keep the pins current, so upgrades
    become explicit reviewable PRs instead of whatever-is-newest-at-startup.
  - *Managed-block boundary on generated conventions* (Trust Hub #3). `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` (and
    their byte-for-byte seed templates) are wrapped in stable, version-free
    `<!-- BEGIN/END quarkus-agentic-scaffolding conventions -->` markers. Phase C is rewritten
    around them: markers present → deterministic replace of the block only, every byte outside
    untouched; markers absent → the existing draft-merge, adding the markers so the next run is
    deterministic. Generated instruction text is now explicitly delimited from user content —
    the injection surface the auditor flagged — and the merge stopped being heuristic.
  - *Probe output is data, never instruction* (Trust Hub #4). New §3 rule: directives found inside
    command output are quoted back as findings, never executed.
  - *Triage template hardened at the ingestion edge* (Snyk W011). `Agent.java.template` now
    demonstrates the secure pattern it should have taught: the two entry sub-agents carry
    `@InputGuardrails(PromptInjectionGuard.class)` (wired from `Guardrails.java.template`, FQN
    `dev.langchain4j.service.guardrail.InputGuardrails` verified against upstream docs); prompts
    delimit the ticket in `<ticket>` markers with a system-message instruction to treat it as data;
    `TriageBridge` rejects blank/over-long input before any model call (4 000 chars, aligned with
    the guardrail); and the failure path stops leaking internals — `emitter.fail(e)` and
    `ProgressUpdate.error(t.getMessage())` are replaced by full server-side logging plus a generic
    client-safe `ProgressUpdate.failed()`, mirroring the RFC 9457 philosophy at the REST edge.
    `ci/build-from-templates.sh` compiles green against platform 3.38.1. One honest caveat: docs
    confirm guardrails on `@RegisterAiService` interfaces, but not explicitly when such an
    interface is invoked as an `@Agent` sub-agent; the sub-agents are ordinary CDI AI-service
    proxies, so the guard should run, but that is inference — worth a runtime assertion in a
    scaffolded project.
  - *`SECURITY.md` added.* States the trust boundary the skills operate under (read-only probes,
    approval before any mutation, no piped installers, pinned sources, no plaintext secrets,
    managed blocks, secure-by-default templates) and routes vulnerability reports to private
    GitHub security advisories.

## v0.15.0 — 2026-08-10
- **Refreshed the model defaults** (EVOLUTION-PLAN item 4). Chat goes from `llama3.2` /
  `llama3.2:1b` to **`qwen3:4b`** and **`qwen3:1.7b`** (the `smaller` named model): qwen3 is what
  the official quarkus-langchain4j Ollama guide uses, and its tool-calling is markedly better —
  which is precisely what the tool and agent templates exercise. The in-process embedding model
  goes from `langchain4j-embeddings-all-minilm-l6-v2` to
  **`langchain4j-embeddings-bge-small-en-v15-q`**, upstream Easy RAG's recommendation, with a
  better MTEB score at a similar footprint. Both artifacts stay managed by
  `quarkus-langchain4j-bom` (no version pin); a local build against platform 3.38.1 resolved the
  new one at 1.17.2-beta27 and compiled green. Touches `application.properties.template`,
  `pom.xml.template`, `RagSetup.java.template`, the `scaffold-project` RAG section, and
  `docs/VALIDATING-TEMPLATES.md`.
- **Checked and kept `model-id`.** The Ollama guide appears to show `chat-model.model-name`, which
  looked like a wrong key in our templates. It is not: `"model-name"` in the reference is the
  *placeholder for a named configuration*, and the config model generated by
  `quarkus-langchain4j-ollama` 1.12.2 lists `chat-model.model-id` as the real property, with no
  `chat-model.model-name` alongside it. No change — recorded so the question is not re-opened.

## v0.14.0 — 2026-08-10
- **Baseline moved to the Quarkus 3.38 line** (issue #11). `ci/baseline.env` goes to platform
  `3.38.1`, `quarkus-langchain4j-bom` `1.12.2`, and JDK `25.0.4+7.0.LTS`. Nothing in 3.38 required
  a corrective change: all six items in the 3.38 migration guide have zero surface in this
  repository, and the weekly cron had already built the templates against 3.38.1 successfully
  before the bump. The `QUARKUS_LANGCHAIN4J_BOM_VERSION` comment now spells out that the line is a
  release watcher and not what a build resolves — it read `1.12.0` while platform 3.37.2 actually
  shipped `1.11.2`.
- **`@Skills` in the conventions and templates.** The 3.38 line carries quarkus-langchain4j
  `1.12.x`, which introduces the `@Skills` annotation (`io.quarkiverse.langchain4j.skills`;
  verified present in `quarkus-langchain4j-skills` 1.12.2 and absent in 1.11.2 — the artifact
  itself already existed, only the annotation is new). A service annotated with `@Skills` gets an
  `activate_skill` tool plus a system message advertising the available skills, so reusable
  instructions live in `SKILL.md` files instead of an ever-growing `@SystemMessage`. Added to the
  extension menu, to `AiService.java.template` and `application.properties.template` as commented
  blocks, and as a §4 convention. The extension is `status:preview`, which the text says plainly;
  it stays out of the CI extension list for that reason.
- **`quarkus-http-problem` in the extension menu** (issue #10). Errors escaping a REST resource
  become RFC 9457 `application/problem+json` instead of a raw 500 with a stack trace — relevant
  here because a model timeout, a dead inference endpoint, or a throwing tool would otherwise leak
  prompts and internal names. Added as optional-recommended, with a §3 convention and a commented
  configuration block.

  Correcting the issue's premise: the extension **is** in `io.quarkus.platform:quarkus-bom` from
  3.38.0 (0 occurrences in the 3.37.2 BOM, 2 in 3.38.0 and 3.38.1 on Maven Central), so it needs
  **no** explicit `<version>` and is *not* the exception to the "no version pins" convention that
  the issue anticipated. The extension's own README still states the opposite; the BOM is
  authoritative. Its current version is 3.38.1, not the 3.33.2 recorded when the issue was filed.

## v0.13.3 — 2026-08-10
- **Hardened the two credible findings from the skills.sh security audits.** Both Gen Agent Trust
  Hub and Snyk rated `setup-agentic-scaffolding` HIGH, on two counts worth acting on:
  - *Piped installer.* Phase A led with `curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash` as a way to install
    JBang. Package managers (SDKMAN, Homebrew, Chocolatey/Scoop) are now the documented path, and a
    new Phase A rule forbids piping a downloaded script into a shell on the agent's own initiative —
    the one-liner is a last resort, named as the trade-off it is, and only after the user approves
    that specific command.
  - *Credential handling.* Phase B told the agent to append `--api-key <KEY>` for context7, which
    puts a secret into a command and a config file verbatim. The stdio server already falls back to
    the `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` environment variable when the flag is absent, so the skill now registers
    context7 with no key argument at all and tells the user to export the key. Added a blanket
    "never handle a secret in plaintext" rule covering chat, config writes, and verification output.
    `README.md`'s three manual-fallback snippets were updated to match.

  The other two findings (prompt-injection surface from writing the conventions file;
  command-execution from `java -version` / `docker version` probes) describe what the skill is for
  and were left alone.

## v0.13.2 — 2026-08-10
- **Fixed the dead Quarkus LTS link.** The scheduled link check caught a 404 on
  `https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-lts-releases/`, referenced by the `scaffold-project` skill
  where it tells the agent to pick the current LTS instead of hardcoding a version. Replaced with
  [`https://quarkus.io/releases/`](https://quarkus.io/releases/), which lists the active LTS lines
  and their support windows — a better fit for the "don't hardcode a number that will rot"
  instruction than the 2023 policy announcement post.

## v0.13.1 — 2026-07-21
- **README fixes.** The skills.sh badge image now uses the `www.skills.sh` host directly (the
  apex-domain URL 308-redirects, which GitHub's image proxy does not follow, breaking the image)
  and links to the project's own skills.sh page instead of the site root. The "What's inside"
  repository tree moved below the usage sections so Quick install and The flow lead the page.

## v0.13.0 — 2026-07-21
- **Hard-stop MCP gate.** Closed the rationalization loophole where agents proceeded to scaffold
  manually when the Quarkus Agents MCP was down. Conventions §1 (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) now
  require verifying the MCP is reachable (`quarkus_*` tools present + a cheap `quarkus_status`
  call) before any Quarkus task, and mandate an immediate STOP — report what is missing, point the
  user to `/setup-agentic-scaffolding` (and to restarting the session), and end the turn — with no
  fallback to the Quarkus CLI, Maven/Gradle archetypes, model memory, or web search. Added a
  matching "verify the MCP first" procedural gate at the top of the `scaffold-project` and
  `audit-project` skills. `/setup-agentic-scaffolding` remains the sole exception. Motivated by
  observed agent behavior of proceeding manually when the MCP is down.

## v0.12.1 — 2026-07-21
- **Grouped skill selection in the skills.sh installer.** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` now declares
  the `skills` array explicitly, so `npx skills add` presents a selectable "Quarkus Agentic
  Scaffolding" group node that toggles all three skills at once (individual selection still
  works). No behavior change for Claude Code plugin installs, which already auto-discover
  `skills/`.

## v0.12.0 — 2026-07-21
- **Plugin machine id renamed `quarkus-agentic` → `quarkus-agentic-scaffolding`** so the repository
  name, install command, and plugin id all match. The human `displayName` ("Quarkus Agentic
  Scaffolding") is unchanged. Updated across every manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` +
  `marketplace.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`,
  `gemini-extension.json`), the `plugins/quarkus-agentic-scaffolding/` Codex wrapper directory, and
  all namespaced invocation forms (`/quarkus-agentic-scaffolding:<skill>`) in the README and skills.
- **Breaking for existing installs.** Because the id changed, a plugin installed under the old
  `quarkus-agentic` id must be reinstalled: uninstall the old id, then reinstall under
  `quarkus-agentic-scaffolding`. Skills and templates are otherwise unchanged.

## v0.11.0 — 2026-07-21
- **Restructured the single umbrella skill into an explicit three-skill flow** split along the
  invocation axis (see `docs/FLOW-REDESIGN-PLAN.md`):
  - **New `setup-agentic-scaffolding`** (user-invoked, `disable-model-invocation: true`) — the
    flow's entry point. Verifies the toolchain (JDK 25 / GraalVM, JBang, container runtime),
    registers the Quarkus Agents MCP + context7 for the running agent, and writes the conventions
    file into the user's project. Ships byte-for-byte seed copies of the root conventions
    (`templates/conventions-CLAUDE.md`, `templates/conventions-AGENTS.md`).
  - **`quarkus-langchain4j-scaffolding` renamed to `scaffold-project`** (model-invoked umbrella,
    owner decision D6 — creation + components stay one skill). Its creation path was reworked
    around the Quarkus Agents MCP surface: `quarkus_create` defaults (`noCode=true`,
    `noWrapper=false`), the mandatory extension-selection gate, a `git init`/commit step before
    `quarkus_skills`/`quarkus_start`, and `devui-testing_runTests` dev-mode verification.
  - **New `audit-project`** (user-invoked, `disable-model-invocation: true`) — read-only
    conformance/adoption audit of an existing project against the §2–§5 conventions, the package
    layout, and the dependency/properties baseline; applies fixes only on confirmation by handing
    off to `scaffold-project`'s component sections.
- **README rewritten around the flow.** Quick install (skills CLI) leads, now installing all three
  skills and covering IBM Bob as a first-class agent; added a **The flow** section
  (setup → scaffold → audit) and the skills.sh badge; collapsed the three near-duplicate per-agent
  prerequisite walkthroughs into a single `/setup-agentic-scaffolding` step plus a manual fallback
  each; documented both slash-command invocation forms (bare via skills-CLI installs,
  `/quarkus-agentic:<skill>` via plugin installs); fixed the stale "current version is 0.10.0"
  prose line.
- **CI gates extended.** `ci/check-version-consistency.sh` now covers all three `SKILL.md` files
  (nine versioned files total, up from seven); `ci/check-conventions-parity.sh` additionally
  verifies the two setup-skill seed copies are byte-for-byte identical to the root `CLAUDE.md` /
  `AGENTS.md`; `ci/build-from-templates.sh` and the validate-templates workflow point at
  `skills/scaffold-project/templates/`.
- **Distribution manifests** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json`,
  `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `gemini-extension.json`) describe the three-skill flow, with
  `scaffolding`, `setup`, `audit`, and `mcp` keywords; `gemini-extension.json` keeps
  `contextFileName: AGENTS.md`. `scripts/install-bob-skill.sh` now installs all three skills
  (same CLI shape) and is documented as a fallback, since `npx skills add` covers Bob natively.
- All version headers synchronized to 0.11.0.

## v0.10.1 — 2026-07-13
- Added a `displayName` of "Quarkus Agentic Scaffolding" to the plugin so the Claude Code UI
  shows a proper human-readable label instead of the prettified `quarkus-agentic` slug. The field
  is set in both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and the `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` plugin
  entry (the marketplace entry wins for users installing from this marketplace, with `plugin.json`
  as the fallback), so installed users see the new name. The `name` identifier stays
  `quarkus-agentic`, so skill namespacing and install identity are unchanged. `displayName`
  requires Claude Code v2.1.143+ and falls back to `name` on older clients. This brings the Claude
  Code manifests to parity with the Codex manifest, which already carried the same display name.
- All version headers synchronized to 0.10.1.

## v0.10.0 — 2026-07-10
- Added MCP scaffolding in both directions: `McpClient.java.template` (an AI service consuming
  MCP tools via `@McpToolBox`, with `streamable-http`/`stdio` client config in
  `application.properties.template`) and `McpServer.java.template` (exposing the app's own
  `TicketTools` as an MCP server via `io.quarkiverse.mcp.server` `@Tool`, versioned by the
  platform member BOM `quarkus-mcp-server-bom` — no pins). SKILL.md gained MCP client (§6) and
  MCP server (§7) sections; the CI extension list now covers `langchain4j-mcp` and
  `mcp-server-http`.
- Conventions: CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md now cover zero-code AI observability (Micrometer +
  OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation, GenAI token-usage/cost metrics, per-tool spans) and
  declarative fault tolerance on AI-service methods (`@Timeout`/`@Retry`/`@Fallback`, with the
  `@Timeout` × tool-calling-loops caveat), plus the GraalVM native-baseline note (no GraalVM
  releases for JDK 26, 27, or 28 — native stays on the JDK 25 baseline until JDK 29).
  `application.properties.template` and `AiService.java.template` carry commented, opt-in
  examples for both.
- New CI gate: `ci/check-conventions-parity.sh` + a `conventions-parity` job in the quality
  workflow — CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md are now diffed under typography normalization so a
  convention edit can no longer land on one side only (a pre-existing one-character drift was
  fixed in the process).
- Added `gemini-extension.json` so the repository can be listed in the Gemini CLI extensions
  gallery (declares the required Quarkus Agents MCP + context7 servers; `contextFileName`
  delivers `AGENTS.md`); it is now the seventh version-carrying file, enforced by the extended
  `ci/check-version-consistency.sh`.
- All version headers synchronized to 0.10.0.

## v0.9.0 — 2026-07-10
- Added a real CI backstop: `ci/build-from-templates.sh` reconstructs a project from the
  templates by convention and compiles it; the `validate-templates` workflow runs it on PRs
  (against `ci/baseline.env`) and weekly against the live latest platform, opening or updating a
  tracking issue on scheduled failures (closed manually once a later run is green); the `quality`
  workflow adds version-consistency, shellcheck, actionlint, and markdownlint gates; scheduled
  link checking via lychee.
- Added `renovate.json` + `ci/baseline.env`: Renovate watches Quarkus platform, the
  quarkus-langchain4j BOM, and new OpenJDK GA releases (java-version datasource) on the
  Dependency Dashboard (approval mode — no automatic PRs). Activation requires installing the
  Mend Renovate app.
- Closed template capability gaps: `Tools.java.template` (@Tool CDI beans + wiring),
  `Guardrails.java.template` (upstream input/output guardrails), `AiServiceTest.java.template`
  (@QuarkusTest wiring smoke test + commented model-dependent and eval examples), and commented
  loop/conditional/error-handler/human-in-the-loop variants in `Agent.java.template`;
  `pom.xml.template` gained the test-scoped `quarkus-langchain4j-testing-evaluation-junit5`
  dependency (version managed by the platform BOM); SKILL.md gained tool/guardrail/test-scaffolding
  sections and the layout gained `tools/` and `guardrails/`; CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md §4–§5 now cover
  tools, guardrails, and the eval framework.
- All version headers synchronized to 0.9.0.

## v0.8.0 — 2026-07-10
- Documented a universal install path via the skills.sh CLI (`npx skills add
  eldermoraes/quarkus-agentic-scaffolding`), which detects and installs the scaffolding skill into
  any Agent Skills-compatible agent (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, opencode, and
  others). Verified end-to-end against the live CLI. The conventions files and the required MCP
  tooling remain per-agent manual steps, as before.
- All version headers synchronized to 0.8.0.

## v0.7.0 — 2026-06-08
- **Fixed Bob support, which had been modeled on a non-existent CLI.** Removed the hallucinated
  `bob plugin marketplace add` / `bob plugin add` and `bob mcp add` commands (IBM Bob has no plugin
  CLI or marketplace), and removed `BOB.md` and `.bob-plugin/`. Verified against `bob.ibm.com/docs`:
  Bob reads the same `AGENTS.md` as Codex, discovers skills under `.bob/skills/`, and configures MCP
  servers via `.bob/mcp.json` (or the MCP tab in the UI). Added `scripts/install-bob-skill.sh` to
  copy the skill into a project's (or global `~/.bob/skills/`) skills directory, and documented the
  Quarkus Agents MCP + context7 setup as a `.bob/mcp.json` entry
  (`jbang quarkus-agent-mcp@quarkusio`, `npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp`). The Quarkus Agents MCP is a
  standalone MCP server whose docs list IBM Bob as a supported client.
- **Fixed the Codex setup commands.** Replaced the non-existent `codex plugin add` with installing
  the plugin from the `/plugins` list after `codex plugin marketplace add`, and switched the Quarkus
  Agents MCP from a (non-existent) Codex plugin to
  `codex mcp add quarkus-agent -- jbang quarkus-agent-mcp@quarkusio`. Added a "Try it" step for parity.
- `AGENTS.md` is now the shared conventions file for both Codex and Bob; `README.md` and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` updated to drop `BOB.md` / `.bob-plugin/` and reflect the per-agent install paths.
- All version headers synchronized to 0.7.0.

## v0.6.0 — 2026-06-03
- Slimmed `pom.xml.template` from a full pom to a dependency reference. The project shell (platform
  BOMs, build plugins, the `-parameters` flag, the `native` profile, the test stack, version pins) is
  generated up to date by `quarkus_create` — the same codestart generator behind code.quarkus.io — so
  hand-maintaining it only caused drift (see v0.5.0). The template now keeps only what generators do
  not provide: the curated extension list and the non-extension `dev.langchain4j` deps (embedding
  model, PDF parser). Updated `SKILL.md` §3 and the `VALIDATING-TEMPLATES.md` reconcile step to match.
- All version headers synchronized to 0.6.0.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-06-03
- Switched the generated REST JSON serializer from JSON-B to Jackson
  (`quarkus-rest-jsonb` → `quarkus-rest-jackson`): `pom.xml.template`, the §3 REST convention in
  `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `BOB.md`, the `SKILL.md` dependency baseline, and the
  `docs/VALIDATING-TEMPLATES.md` extension list. Jackson is the Quarkus default JSON serializer,
  confirmed via the Quarkus Agents MCP against the `rest-json` guide. The Java templates use plain
  records (no JSON-B annotations), so no code changes were required.
- Reconciled the `pom.xml.template` platform baseline `3.36.0` → `3.36.1` to match the current
  Quarkus platform (verified via `quarkus_create`); all 14 template files compile against it.
- All version headers synchronized to 0.5.0.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-06-03
- Added native Bob support alongside the existing Claude and Codex support: `BOB.md`,
  `.bob-plugin/plugin.json`, and Bob-specific plugin metadata for the scaffolding skill.
- README: documented Bob prerequisites, plugin installation, and the relationship between
  `BOB.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the shared scaffolding skill.
- CONTRIBUTING: updated ownership and versioning guidance to include Bob in the list of supported
  agents.
- All version headers synchronized to 0.4.0 across `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `BOB.md`, `SKILL.md`, and all plugin manifests.


## v0.3.0 — 2026-06-03
- Added native Codex support alongside the existing Claude support: `AGENTS.md`,
  `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, a non-duplicating
  `plugins/quarkus-agentic/` marketplace wrapper, and Codex app metadata for the scaffolding
  skill.
- README: documented Codex prerequisites, plugin installation, and the relationship between
  `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the shared scaffolding skill.
- CONTRIBUTING: updated ownership and versioning guidance so future changes keep Claude and Codex
  surfaces in sync.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-06-01
- Packaged as an installable Claude Code **plugin**: added `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (the repository is both the marketplace and the plugin). The
  `CLAUDE.md` conventions remain a per-project drop-in, since a plugin cannot deliver them.
- README: replaced the manual skill-zip upload with plugin install (`/plugin marketplace add` +
  `/plugin install`); added exact install commands for the required Quarkus Agents MCP and
  context7; documented `CLAUDE.md` precedence and how to revert a global install.
- Refreshed the Quarkus platform baseline in `pom.xml.template` from `3.35.3` to `3.36.0` (verified
  current via the Quarkus Agents MCP) and clarified that the pinned version is a reference baseline.
- Verified all templates compile against Quarkus `3.36.0` (Java 25), including the LangChain4j
  agentic API; added `docs/VALIDATING-TEMPLATES.md` describing the procedure.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` (replacing the README placeholder).

## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-01
- Initial release.
- `CLAUDE.md` baseline conventions distilled from real-world Quarkus + LangChain4j practice,
  combined with a modern-Java baseline.
- `quarkus-langchain4j-scaffolding` skill with templates for project setup
  (`pom.xml`, `application.properties`), AI services, agents, and RAG pipelines.
