# Fixture test for the managed-block removal procedure published in README.md's
# "Uninstall" section.
#
# A one-liner that deletes a region of the user's own CLAUDE.md does not validate by
# reading. The earlier design used `sed -i` with a count-based precheck; three inputs
# passed that precheck and still destroyed user-authored lines (see the spec, Finding 1).
# Every one of those inputs is a fixture here.
#
# Three properties are asserted:
#   1. The precheck says OK-SAFE-TO-REMOVE only for one complete, in-order marker pair.
#   2. On every input the precheck REFUSES, running the removal anyway leaves the file
#      byte-for-byte identical - so a user who ignores the precheck is still safe.
#   3. Group D pins the accepted residual: a marker quoted at column 0 counts as real to
#      both commands, so the precheck cannot tell a genuine pair from a quoted one. Those
#      fixtures record shipped behavior, not bugs (see the spec, Finding 1, "Residual").
#
# Plus a drift guard: README.md must still publish these exact commands.
