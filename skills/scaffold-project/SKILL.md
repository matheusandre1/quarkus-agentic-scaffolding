description: Scaffold Quarkus + LangChain4j projects end-to-end and add agentic components to existing ones — AI services, tools, agents and multi-agent workflows, RAG pipelines, MCP clients and servers (Model Context Protocol), guardrails, and embedding store setups. Use this whenever the user asks to create, scaffold, set up, bootstrap, initialize, start, generate, or kickstart a new Quarkus + LangChain4j project or module, OR to add an AI service, tool, agent, RAG component, MCP client or server integration, guardrail, or embedding store to an existing project in this stack. Also use for generating baseline pom.xml, application.properties, project layout, or starter classes for Quarkus + LangChain4j work.

# Quarkus + LangChain4j Scaffolding
# Version: 0.19.1

**Prerequisites.** The Quarkus Agents MCP, context7, and the project conventions file
(`CLAUDE.md` for Claude, `AGENTS.md` for Codex) should already be configured — if they are
not, run `/setup-agentic-scaffolding` first. Invoke this skill as `/scaffold-project`, or as
`/quarkus-agentic-scaffolding:scaffold-project` when it is installed as a plugin; it also triggers
automatically when you ask to create a project or add a component.

## Gate: verify the MCP first

**Do this before anything else — before reading the project, before §1.** Scaffolding is Quarkus
work, so the Quarkus Agents MCP is mandatory (conventions §1). VERIFY it is reachable: confirm the
`quarkus_*` tools are present in your toolset and that a cheap call (e.g. `quarkus_status`)
succeeds. If the tools are absent or the call fails, STOP immediately: report exactly what is
missing, point the user to `/setup-agentic-scaffolding` (and to restarting the session after
registering it, since MCPs load at session start), and end the turn. A missing or unreachable MCP
is never permission to proceed manually — do not fall back to the Quarkus CLI, Maven/Gradle
archetypes, model memory, or web search, and do not offer to "continue without it". Only once the
gate passes do you continue below.

## 1. When to use this skill

This skill has two roles:

- **Create a Quarkus + LangChain4j project end-to-end** — scaffold, bootstrap, initialize,
  generate, or kickstart a new project or module, from `quarkus_create` through a running,
  test-green dev mode (§2–§3, §11–§13).
- **Add a component to an existing project** — a new AI service (§4), tools (§5), MCP client
  (§6) or server (§7), agent or multi-agent workflow (§8), RAG pipeline (§9), guardrails
  (§10), or embedding store. These requests auto-trigger the skill.

It covers *how to lay things out and get them running*. It does **not** restate coding
conventions — see §14.

Everything here goes through the Quarkus Agents MCP and context7 (see the prerequisites note
above): create projects and discover extensions with `quarkus_create` / `quarkus_searchTools`,
call `quarkus_skills` for each chosen extension **before** writing any code, and look up
LangChain4j and other library APIs with context7. The Quarkus Agents MCP itself is a hard
prerequisite — verify it up front per the **Gate** above; if any other required tool is
unavailable, stop and report it rather than guessing.

## 2. Project layout convention

Single-module Quarkus application (no multi-module reactor by default). Organize one root
package into focused sub-packages:

```
src/main/java/<group>/<app>/
  ai/         # @RegisterAiService interfaces (AI services and agents)
  tools/      # @Tool CDI beans the AI services can call
  guardrails/ # input/output guardrails (optional)
  mcp/        # MCP server features (@Tool/@Prompt/@Resource offered to remote MCP clients)
  dto/        # records: inputs, reports, and event/step types
  workflow/   # agentic orchestrators + the streaming-bridge beans
  rest/       # JAX-RS resources (@Path)
  web/        # WebSocket endpoints (@WebSocket)
  rag/        # RagConfig producers (only when escalating beyond Easy RAG)
  memory/     # chat-memory store + provider (optional, persistent memory)
src/main/resources/
  application.properties
  rag/        # documents folder ingested by Easy RAG (quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.path)
```

Start with only the sub-packages a feature needs; add the rest as the project grows. This
layout is owned by the skill — `quarkus_create` does not impose it.

## 3. Creating a new project

Create the project through the Quarkus Agents MCP `quarkus_create` — never by hand, and never
with Maven, Gradle, or the Quarkus CLI. `quarkus_create` both generates the project **and
auto-starts dev mode**, so run the steps below in order.

**Required parameters.** `quarkus_create` takes `outputDir`, `noCode`, and `noWrapper`. Present
these recommended defaults to the user and confirm before generating:

- `noCode=true` — this repo's opinionated templates (§4–§13) replace the codestart
  hello-world, so skip the generated sample code.
- `noWrapper=false` — keep the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`) so the project builds without a local
  Maven install.
- `outputDir` — the target directory for the new project.

**Choose the Quarkus version up front.** There is no `streams` parameter. Decide LTS vs. latest
with the user before generating: pass `quarkusVersion` explicitly to pin a release — pick the
current LTS from the [Quarkus releases page](https://quarkus.io/releases/)
rather than hardcoding a number that will rot — or omit `quarkusVersion` to take the latest
platform release.

**Extension selection is a mandatory user gate.** `quarkus_create`'s own contract requires the
extension list to be chosen, not assumed. Present this capability-based menu with the
recommended default and **wait for the user's choice** before generating:

- core (recommended default): `rest`, `rest-jackson`, `smallrye-openapi`, `websockets-next`,
  `langchain4j-ollama`
- agents: add `langchain4j-agentic`
- RAG: add `langchain4j-easy-rag`
- MCP client: add `langchain4j-mcp`
- MCP server: add `mcp-server-http` (`io.quarkiverse.mcp`; use `mcp-server-stdio` for a
  subprocess server)
- observability (optional): add `micrometer-registry-prometheus` and `opentelemetry`
- fault tolerance (optional): add `smallrye-fault-tolerance`
- error contract (optional, recommended for any REST app): add `http-problem`
  (`io.quarkiverse.httpproblem`; RFC 9457 `application/problem+json` at the REST edge, so an
  escaping exception stops surfacing as a raw 500 with a stack trace)
- agent skills (optional): add `langchain4j-skills` (`io.quarkiverse.langchain4j`; lets the app
  load `SKILL.md`-format skills at runtime — `status:preview`, so treat its API as unstable)

(`quarkus-arc` comes in automatically.) The generated `pom.xml` already imports the
`quarkus-bom` and `quarkus-langchain4j-bom` platform BOMs, sets Java 25, enables the
`-parameters` compiler flag, adds a `native` profile, and pulls in the test stack
(`quarkus-junit` + `rest-assured`) — all at the resolved platform version. Do not hand-maintain
any of that: `quarkus_create` (the same codestart generator behind code.quarkus.io) keeps it up
to date.

**Put the generated project under git immediately.** Before any further MCP call, run
`git init && git add -A && git commit` inside the generated project directory — the Quarkus
Agents MCP refuses to operate on a project that is not under git control, so `quarkus_start`
and `quarkus_skills` fail until this is done.

**Learn each extension's patterns before writing code.** Call `quarkus_skills` for every
selected extension (comma-separated queries are supported) before scaffolding against it — this
is mandatory, not optional — and use context7 for LangChain4j and other library API lookups.

**Add the non-extension dependencies.** Project generators add only Quarkus extensions, so add
the `dev.langchain4j` dependencies from `templates/pom.xml.template` by hand: the embedding
model (required by Easy RAG) and, for PDF ingestion, the document parser.

Then lay out the sub-packages (§2), drop in the templates you need (§4–§10), write the
`application.properties` baseline (§11), and verify (§12).

## 4. AI service scaffolding

Use `templates/AiService.java.template`. It is a `@RegisterAiService` interface with
`@SystemMessage` / `@UserMessage` prompts and a typed return value, plus an optional
`@RegisterAiService(modelName = "…")` for selecting a named model. Pair it with a `rest/`
resource or a `web/` WebSocket endpoint to expose it.

## 5. Tool scaffolding

Use `templates/Tools.java.template`. Tools are plain `@ApplicationScoped` CDI beans with
`@Tool`-annotated methods the model may call. Wire them globally with
`@RegisterAiService(tools = TicketTools.class)` or per method with `@ToolBox(TicketTools.class)`.
Tools run blocking by default; keep blocking I/O (DB, REST) off the event loop by annotating the
method `@RunOnVirtualThread`. Validate a tool's arguments or results with tool-level guardrails —
see §10.

## 6. MCP client scaffolding (consume remote MCP tools)

Use `templates/McpClient.java.template`. An AI service can take its tools from one or more MCP
servers: annotate the service method with `@McpToolBox("name")`
(`io.quarkiverse.langchain4j.mcp.runtime`) — or `@McpToolBox` with no name to activate every
configured client — and declare each named client in `application.properties`
(`quarkus.langchain4j.mcp.<name>.transport-type` + `.url`; prefer `streamable-http`, or
`stdio` + `.command` for a local subprocess server). Requires the `langchain4j-mcp` extension (the
platform BOM manages its version). Local `@Tool` beans (§5) and MCP toolboxes combine freely on
the same service. Each client adds a readiness health check; disable with
`quarkus.langchain4j.mcp.health.enabled=false` when the remote server is optional at startup.

## 7. MCP server scaffolding (expose your app as an MCP server)

Use `templates/McpServer.java.template`. Annotate business methods with `@Tool` / `@ToolArg`
from `io.quarkiverse.mcp.server` (plus `@Prompt` / `@Resource` for reusable prompts and data)
to offer them to any MCP client over Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`
(`quarkus.mcp.server.http.root-path`). Requires the `mcp-server-http` extension
(`io.quarkiverse.mcp`, managed by the platform's `quarkus-mcp-server-bom` — no version pin);
use `mcp-server-stdio` instead when a desktop client spawns the app as a subprocess. Do not
confuse the two `@Tool` annotations: `io.quarkiverse.mcp.server.Tool` offers a method to remote
MCP clients, while `dev.langchain4j.agent.tool.Tool` (§5) offers it to your own model — the
template delegates to the `TicketTools` bean so one implementation backs both. Enable
`quarkus.mcp.server.traffic-logging.enabled=true` to watch the JSON-RPC exchanges in dev.

## 8. Agent scaffolding

Use `templates/Agent.java.template`. It shows the full declarative agentic shape:

- individual `@Agent` AI services (sub-agents) returning records;
- an orchestrator interface using `@SequenceAgent` / `@ParallelAgent` (and the
  `@SupervisorAgent` + `@SupervisorRequest` variant for routing) with `@Output` assembling the
  result from the `AgenticScope`;
- an `@ApplicationScoped` streaming bridge that runs the blocking workflow on a virtual thread
  and emits progress over a Mutiny `Multi`;
- the `@WebSocket` endpoint that delegates to the bridge.

The entry agents (the ones that see the raw ticket) are annotated with
`@InputGuardrails(PromptInjectionGuard.class)` — the guard from the Guardrails template (§10).
**Any workflow whose entry point ingests free text from outside MUST attach input guardrails and
delimit that text in the prompt** (wrapped in markers, with the system message saying it is data
and not instructions); guardrails are not optional on an exposed entry path. Downstream agents
that only read model-produced state do not need them. Validate at the edge too — the bridge
rejects blank or over-long tickets before the workflow starts — and never return exception text
to the client: log the failure in full, emit a generic error, as the socket's `@OnError` does.

Requires the `quarkus-langchain4j-agentic` extension. Call `quarkus_skills` for it before writing
the workflow.

## 9. RAG pipeline scaffolding

Use `templates/RagSetup.java.template`. Default to **Easy RAG**: add `quarkus-langchain4j-easy-rag`
plus an in-process embedding model (`langchain4j-embeddings-bge-small-en-v15-q`), drop documents
into the folder referenced by `quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.path`, and let Quarkus ingest them on
startup — no retriever code required. The template also includes a commented, **opt-in** manual
path (a CDI-produced `EmbeddingStore` + `EmbeddingStoreContentRetriever` + `RetrievalAugmentor`)
to use **only when a project needs control Easy RAG does not provide**.

## 10. Guardrails

Use `templates/Guardrails.java.template`. Guardrails are `@ApplicationScoped` CDI beans that
validate an AI service's inputs (`InputGuardrail`) and outputs (`OutputGuardrail`); attach them
with `@InputGuardrails(…)` / `@OutputGuardrails(…)` on the AI-service method or interface. Use the
upstream `dev.langchain4j.guardrail` API — the Quarkus-specific guardrail API was removed. An
output guardrail can force the model to answer again with `reprompt(…)`; cap attempts with
`quarkus.langchain4j.guardrails.max-retries` (default 3, 0 disables). The Agent template (§8)
shows `PromptInjectionGuard` wired onto the agents that ingest untrusted text.

## 11. `application.properties` baseline

Use `templates/application.properties.template` — this baseline is owned by the skill, not
generated by `quarkus_create`. It configures the Ollama provider with a local default model
(cloud models shown as comments), a named `smaller` model for cheap subtasks, generous timeouts,
request/response logging, disabled Dev Services, and the Easy RAG documents path. A commented MCP
client block declares the named `ops` client used in §6. A commented MCP server block sets the
Streamable HTTP path and traffic logging for §7. A commented observability block wires OTLP trace
export and dev-only prompt/completion capture.

## 12. After scaffolding

`quarkus_create` already started dev mode, so verify through the Quarkus Agents MCP — never
invoke Maven or Gradle directly. Run the tests with `quarkus_callTool` `devui-testing_runTests`,
and inspect failures with `quarkus_callTool` `devui-exceptions_getLastException` (fall back to
`quarkus_logs` for broader context). Keep the §13 wiring smoke test green.

To audit or bring an existing project in line with these conventions later, `/audit-project`
runs a read-only conformance check and hands any fixes back to this skill's component sections.

## 13. Test scaffolding

Use `templates/AiServiceTest.java.template`. Its active content is a `@QuarkusTest` wiring smoke
test (`ChatAssistantTest`) that injects the `ChatAssistant` AI service and asserts it is non-null:
booting Quarkus builds the CDI container and the AI-service proxy, so a green test proves wiring
and augmentation succeeded **without calling the model and without a running Ollama** — only
`quarkus-junit` is needed. The template also carries commented, opt-in examples: a model-dependent
test (live Ollama, `temperature=0`) and an **AI-quality evaluation** example (`Scorer` /
`@EvaluationTest` with semantic-similarity or AI-judge strategies), backed by
`quarkus-langchain4j-testing-evaluation-junit5` — already listed, test-scoped, in
`templates/pom.xml.template` (the platform BOM manages its version).

## 14. Cross-reference

For coding conventions to apply once scaffolding is done — Java language level, virtual threads,
records/sealed/pattern matching, declarative AI services, streaming, RAG, testing — see the
project's `CLAUDE.md` (Claude) or `AGENTS.md` (Codex). This skill does not duplicate those
conventions.
